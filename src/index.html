                        AxleBot is a <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> bot that I created for me and my friends. It is a <strong>music bot</strong> which allows members in a voice
                        call to listen to music together. It has a wide range of commands such as play, pause, skip, queue, and more. It also has a <strong>queue system</strong> which allows
                        music to be queued up by multiple users. It connects with <strong>Spotify and YouTube APIs</strong> to play a user's specific song or playlist.
                        <br><br>
                        The bot was made with Python using the extensive <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Discord.py</a> library. 
                        It uses FFMPEG to stream music through discord all while being asynchronous!

                        PerthPinpoint is a game which tests your knoweldge about how well you know the city of Perth. Players who are familiar with the city and are able to 
                        decipher clues about their surroundings will be able to score higher points. 
                        PerthPinpoint is based off the popular <a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/">GeoGuessr</a> game - but of course with a local twist.
                        <br><br>
                        The premise is that you are dropped in a random location within Perth. 
                        You are free to explore the location as much as you wish using the Google Street View embed in the game. 
                        Your goal is to guess the original location/street/landmark before the timer runs out!
                        <br><br>
                        Play the game <a target = _blank href="https://perthpinpoint.city/">here</a> and see how well you know Perth!

                        The analysis aimed to investigate the changes in marital status patterns across different age and sex groups in Australia from 1996 to 2021 through ABS Census data.
                        A scientific report was made with how the data was obtained, assumptions, cleaned and analysed. 
                        The project gave significant insight into data cleaning and wrangling, working with raw CSV files (from ABS) and how to conduct a robust data analysis procedure.
                        The data analysis was conducted using Python. Employing imports such as CSV, Matplotlib and Numpy. 
                        The findings were aided visually with plots and graphs using Python's Matplotlib (pyplot) package.

                        Ever needed to sync files across multiple locations like network drives or USBs? I created a command-line utility to keep your directories in perfect harmony. 
                        This tool, built using C11 and POSIX function calls, ensures efficient and reliable synchronization. With Make handling the compilation and execution, it's a breeze to get up and running.

                        Key features include:

                            <li>Globbing: Similar to REGEX, this lets you selectively sync files based on patterns (e.g., only .txt files)</li>
                            <li>Recursive Directory Processing: Sync entire directory trees effortlessly</li>
                            <li>Preservation of File Attributes: Keeps modification times and permissions intact</li>
